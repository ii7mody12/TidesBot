# TidesBot
My personal discord bot.

To run the bot you need you to get a token, which is explained [here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token).
Once you do that, create a token.json file that looks like this: 

```
{
	"Token": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
}
```
