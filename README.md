# TidesBot
My personal discord bot.

To run the bot you need you to get a token, which is explained [here](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token).
Once you do that, create a token.json file that looks like like the token_template.json file.

All commands can be found within the main.py's "help" method.     
The current features of the bot are:    
**User Management:** Changing name color, deleting messages, adding/removing roles, etc.    
**Music: (rewriteMusic credit to [here](https://gist.github.com/EvieePy/ab667b74e9758433b3eb806c53a19f34))** Play music/playlist/twitch streams, vote to skip, etc.    
**Twitch Alerts:** Give a alert when a twitch stream goes live, along with being able to check if a channel is live or not. The alerts happen every 10 minutes.    
**Pokdex (Credit [here](https://github.com/Redjumpman/Jumper-Plugins/blob/master/pokedex/pokedex.py)):** Pull up info on pokemon and items such as where they spawn and their stats by generation.
